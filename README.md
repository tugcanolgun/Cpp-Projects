# Cpp-Projects
This is a collection of repositories that are merged into one. While I was having my Introduction to Object Oriented Programming preliminary class before starting my Master's degree at Bogazici University for Software Engineering, we were asked to do certain basic C++ excercises. As there are several of them, I didn't want my github profile to be crowded. I merged them into this repository and archived the others.

### Project Wiki
Detailed information about each excercise can be found in Wiki.
